# Db2Session

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/db2_session.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/db2_session)

A Rails 5 & Rails 6 plugin for managing queries by sessions of authenticated db2 (i-series) multi-users on a remote db2 server.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'db2_session'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install db2_session
```
## Usage
This plugin highly depends on [Db2Query](https://github.com/yohaneslumentut/db2_query). Where **Db2Query** is responsible to manage database queries and **Db2Session** is only responsible to manage user sessions in the controllers of each query.

Note: Please do the Db2Query [**Installation**](https://github.com/yohaneslumentut/db2_query#1-installation) & [**Initialization**](https://github.com/yohaneslumentut/db2_query#2-initialization) steps before move to the next section.

Rules:
> 1. **Queries** have to extend ApplicationQuery, an abstract query, which inherit all attributes and methods required from Db2Session::ApplicationQuery
> 2. **Controllers** have to extend Db2Controller, an abstract controller, which inherit all attributes and methods required from Db2Session::ApplicationController 

### Mount Engine Authentication Path
To be able to use the **authentication** path, mount the engine at your application `config/routes.rb`
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Db2Session::Engine => "/db2_session"
  ...
end
```
The `db2_session/login` and `db2_session/logout` path is now available at `rails routes`

```bash
$ rails routes
     Prefix Verb URI Pattern           Controller#Action
db2_session      /db2_session          Db2Session::Engine
...
Routes for Db2Session::Engine:
      login POST /login(.:format)      db2_session/sessions#new
     logout GET  /logout(.:format)     db2_session/sessions#delete
...
```

### Query By User Session
***Db2Query** use only one user which is hardcoded at `config/db2query.yml`. Here, at Db2Session query, multi-user can make requests and queries by using their own db2 credential that is securely attached at connection client instance. The plugin will assign the connection to the related user on each request based on an attached token that was created during the `login` process.

Create an abstract query, here we use `ApplicationQuery` that extend `Db2Session::ApplicationQuery`. All of your query class have to extend this class. 

```ruby
class ApplicationQuery < Db2Session::ApplicationQuery
  def self.inherited(subclass)
    subclass.define_query_definitions
  end
end
```

Then create a `Db2ConnectionQuery` that inherit from `ApplicationQUery`

```bash
$ rails g query connection --defines status
```
```ruby
# app/queries/db2_connection_query.rb
class Db2ConnectionQuery < ApplicationQuery
  def status_sql
    "SELECT 1 AS CONNECTED FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
  end
end
```
Update the definitions:
```ruby
# app/queries/definitions/db2_connection_query_definitions.rb
module Definitions
  class Db2ConnectionQueryDefinitions < Db2Query::Definitions
    def describe
      query_definition :status do |c|
        c.connected :boolean
      end
    end
  end
end

```

### Session Controller

Next, create a `Db2Controller` as a base controller and `Db2ConnectionController` that extend `Db2Controller`  where we can render `Db2ConnectionQuery.status`.

```ruby
# app/controllers/db2_controller.rb
class Db2Controller < Db2Session::ApplicationController
end

# app/controllers/db2_connection_controller.rb
class Db2ConnectionController < Db2Controller
  def index
    status = Db2ConnectionQuery.status
    render json: {
      data: {
        user: Db2ConnectionQuery.connection.userid,
        trx_time: Db2ConnectionQuery.connection.trx_time,
        connected: status.connected
      }
    }
  end
end
```
Add the route at `config/routes`:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Db2Session::Engine => "/db2_session"
  get "/db2_connection", to: "db2_connection#index"
end

```

Then check whether the `db2_connection_path` already listed at application routes. 
```bash
$ rails routes
         Prefix Verb URI Pattern               Controller#Action
    db2_session      /db2_session              Db2Session::Engine
 db2_connection GET  /db2_connection(.:format) db2_connection#index

Routes for Db2Session::Engine:
          login POST /login(.:format)          db2_session/sessions#new
         logout GET  /logout(.:format)         db2_session/sessions#delete
```

### Authenticate a Request

First, run your development server
```bash
$ rails s
```
Post a login request with Db2 `userid` and `password` data to get a token.

```bash
$ curl -XPOST -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "userid": "YOHANES", "password": "XXXXXX" }' http://localhost:3000/db2_session/login
```
The installation success if you see response as follow:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none

Content-Length: 35
Connection: Keep-Alive

{"message":"YOHANES are logged in."}
```
Copy the Authorization Bearer token, and use it to check connection status.
```bash
$ curl -XGET -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJkYXRhIjp7InNlc3Npb25fa2V5Ijo0NzM0Mzg2MTIzNTE2MH19.KW5NZo43WT47QiKrXvVyRd2kovY1Y53fSabU2BIx5nc" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/db2_connection
```
Note: Replace the token with your own token that generated during login process.

Then the response will be as follow:
```ruby
 {"data":{"user":"YOHANES","trx_time":14556.481167844,"connected":true}}
```

Now the token can be use on each request to your application.
